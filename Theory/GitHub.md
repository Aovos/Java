| `Branch`       | A parallel Version of your Code that is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch                                                                                                                                            |
| `Clone`        | A full local copy of a repository to work directly on it                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `Fork`         | An independent full copy of a repository, allowing you to modify and develop it separately from the original project, resulting in two projects. Changes can be proposed back to the original, but the forked project can evolve independently                     |
| `Commit`       | Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies the specific changes, when the changes were made and who created the changes |
|                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Pull Request` | A request for review and discussion of changes before the are integrated into another branch                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Merge`        | To take the approved changes from one branch and apply them to another, for example into the main / master                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Remote`       | A centrally stored repository (on a server for example) that you and other developers can access and work on it                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Upstream`     | The original repository from which your fork or branch come from                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
